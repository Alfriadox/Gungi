# Gungi
Gungi is a board game derived from the anime Hunter X Hunter. 
The rules of this game have been speculated about by the fanbase, but no singular rulset is agreed upon.
The rule set implemented by this game was originally detailed [here](https://mmmmalo.tumblr.com/post/74510568781/rules-of-gungi).
These rules are restated in [RULES.md](https://github.com/Alfriadox/Gungi/blob/master/RULES.md).

This implementation implements these rules to the best of its ability.
It it written in Java 11 using Java AWT and Java Swing. Downloadable executables for Windows, macOS, and Linux
should be available when I make a release.
